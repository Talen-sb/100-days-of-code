# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting off the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Learning how to use GitHub, signing up to https://www.freecodecamp.org doing some HTML stuff.

**Thoughts:** Quite excited, actually! It's the beginning of a long journey and I'm looking forward to learn as much as I can throughout this journey.
