# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting off the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Learning how to use GitHub, signing up to https://www.freecodecamp.org doing some HTML stuff.

**Thoughts:** Quite excited, actually! It's the beginning of a long journey and I'm looking forward to learn as much as I can throughout this journey.

### Day 2: March 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about HTML & CSS and how they work together @freecodecamp, specifically about classes, working with images & the font-x attributes using CSS, anchor elements, border attributes, lists and so on. Also trying to link GitHub account to Atom, but for some reason when opening the GitHub tab on it, it doesn't show anything, so it's probably a bug, I guess; if it continues to go like this, I'll open an issue thread since I can't find anything online that would let me fix it.
 
**Thoughts:** Pretty fun so far; it's basically like you are telling the browser in a kind of straight way "do this", "make this smaller", "I want this text to look like this"; and I'm enjoying it so far. It's quite interesting.
