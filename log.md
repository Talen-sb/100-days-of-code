# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting off the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Learning how to use GitHub, signing up to https://www.freecodecamp.org doing some HTML stuff.

**Thoughts:** Quite excited, actually! It's the beginning of a long journey and I'm looking forward to learn as much as I can throughout this journey.

### Day 2: March 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about HTML & CSS and how they work together @freecodecamp, specifically about classes, working with images & the font-x attributes using CSS.

**Thoughts:** Pretty fun so far; it's basically like you are telling the browser in a kind of straight way "do this", "make this smaller", "I want this text to look like this"; and I'm enjoying it so far. It's quite interesting.
