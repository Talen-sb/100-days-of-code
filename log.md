# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting off the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Learning how to use GitHub, signing up to https://www.freecodecamp.org doing some HTML stuff.

**Thoughts:** Quite excited, actually! It's the beginning of a long journey and I'm looking forward to learn as much as I can throughout this journey.

### Day 2: March 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about HTML & CSS and how they work together @freecodecamp, specifically about classes, working with images & the font-x attributes using CSS, anchor elements, border attributes, lists and so on. Also trying to link GitHub account to Atom, but for some reason when opening the GitHub tab on it, it doesn't show anything, so it's probably a bug, I guess; if it continues to go like this, I'll open an issue thread since I can't find anything online that would let me fix it.
 
**Thoughts:** Pretty fun so far; it's basically like you are telling the browser in a kind of straight way "do this", "make this smaller", "I want this text to look like this"; and I'm enjoying it so far. It's quite interesting.

### Day 3: March 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Getting to know how to use "form" stuff: buttons, text input, checkboxes, radio buttons, make them already checkable & how they work in general; also learning about the div element & id attribute and applying CSS to them.

**Thoughts:** I had no access to a computer today nor internet connection, but that didn't stop me 'cause I used an iPad and my phone's navigation data instead. Definitely gonna commit to this no matter what. Looking forward to keep learning!

### Day 4: March 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Didn't do much today, just an hour or so @freeCodeCamp; learning about the padding & margin properties, how to specify them by declaring each side individually or using the Clockwise notation. Also how overriding styles in subsequent CSS works. 

**Thoughts:** This part was interesting, I like the way that freeCodeCamp explains the priority part of CSS. Excited to keep learning again! I'll continue tomorrow since it's a bit late by now and I'm not exactly at home.

### Day 5: March 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continuing to see how overwriting CSS works, as wells as getting to know a bit about applying colors to elements through Hex codes both long & shortened version, and RGB values. So, I'm done with the basic HTML & CSS part; next is Bootstrap!

**Thoughts:** Feels good to have completed the basics of HTML & CSS, and I still have a long path to go through, but I'm really looking forward to it! Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery... I'm coming for you both!

### Day 6: March 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learning Bootstrap, pretty simple so far! Making buttons, using bootstrap classes and stuff. Also, picked up the "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele from udemy.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap seems quite simple; it helps you make stuff more quickly and efficiently, but that's just a thing from all frameworks, I'm guessing; looking forward to keep learning more about it!.
Colt Steele's udemy course looks professional and useful; If I'm going to continue using this yet I don't know, but what I do know is that it's the most likely situation.

### Day 7: March 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learnt a bit more about Bootstrap (cent & made a simple site for roasting purposes towards a friend of mine (Lorenzo Furio; may or may not include italian memes) in order to practice what I've learnt so far @freeCodeCamp; also, @StackOverflow helps A LOT for learning.

**Thoughts:** Spent the morning making a simple website to roast Lorenzo and I feel so damn proud about it, lmao. I'm guessing that counts as a small project, idk. The point is, I did all of that by applying what I've learnt at freeCodeCamp; If I didn't remember something specific, I'd go back and check that part again; If I had an idea or didn't know how to apply it, Stack Overflow was my boy since there was already someone with the same beginnner's doubt that I had, and I feel like it's gonna keep going that way for a bit. Looking forwad to completing this challenge. Â¡Let's go!
